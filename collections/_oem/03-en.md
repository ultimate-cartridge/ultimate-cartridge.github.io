# OEM-3

The following case studies are part of the custom cartridges that have been approved for publication, with some requiring the brand logo to be concealed as they are development prototypes.

Through discussions with Mr. Miyajima, the direction for the new design was determined. We continued to use a wooden case, this time utilizing snakewood, which is said to be the hardest natural wood on Earth. Simulation data confirmed its superior density and hardness; however, due to the instability of the material's toughness, the defect rate during processing increased, ultimately preventing it from reaching formal mass production. Fortunately, this case, which we call the "LEGO structure," demonstrated an extremely low resonance frequency, and we plan to challenge this type of structural design again if the opportunity arises.
