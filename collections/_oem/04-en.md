# OEM-4

The following case studies are part of the custom cartridges that have been approved for publication, with some requiring the brand logo to be concealed as they are development prototypes.

This is a prototype cartridge developed using a new material, featuring a body made of compressed carbon fiber. It achieves weight reduction while maintaining high rigidity. The newly created mounting holes for the purple copper beads allow engineers to freely fine-tune the cartridge's compliance and center of gravity. The magnetic field shaping coil at the tip is derived from the design of Dynavictor.
