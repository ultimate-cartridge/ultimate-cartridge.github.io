# OEM-1

In this attempt to reintroduce snakewood, we leveraged past insights and adopted an open structure. By positioning the center of gravity further forward and minimizing the external metal components, we achieved the highest level of compliance. The structure is based on Jan Allaerts' design proposal and progressed without any particular issues, although there may have been better material options for the housing. Due to requests from the brand side, only 90 units were produced, and we sincerely congratulate the fortunate collectors who acquired these rare 90 units.
