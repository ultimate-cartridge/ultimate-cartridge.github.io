# OEM-5

The following case studies are part of the custom cartridges that have been approved for publication, with some requiring the brand logo to be concealed as they are development prototypes.

This design is reminiscent of the original Koetsu, with all aspects tailored to reproduce a classic sound. Special Alnico magnets feature a longer magnetic circuit, while the shape of the wooden side panels is crafted to make the resonance frequency perceptible to the ear, enhancing the overall resonance. The coil material is a rare type of oxygen-free copper enamel wire that has been stored for over 20 years.
