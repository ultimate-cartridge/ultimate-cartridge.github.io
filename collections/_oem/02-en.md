# OEM-2

This is a prototype cartridge developed for a European brand, aiming for a unified style with their flagship tonearm. The processing of the crystal was extremely challenging, and the actual measurement data after cartridge assembly deviated significantly from the simulation results. After repeatedly exchanging the magnet and magnetic pole plate, the issue was ultimately resolved by adopting the same magnetic pole components as the Bluelectric. The acute angles that occur during the manufacturing of the magnetic pole plates have a significant impact on the magnetic field, so we will no longer use magnetic pole plates with acute angles in the future. Notably, this cartridge achieved a world-first single-point damping structure, where the entire housing is supported by the diamond at the tip without using a single drop of adhesive, resulting in very ideal sound quality. However, due to the high difficulty of assembly for mass production, this structure was abandoned, and the diamond was only used as decoration at the tip of the cartridge, which is truly regrettable.
