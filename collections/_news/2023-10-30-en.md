This is the most exciting repair commission of the year - another Neumann cutting lathe, but an even older and extremely rare model.
Both the power amplifier section and logic circuits are intact, though the wiring is disconnected and connectors are missing. The logic circuits are all in the earliest gate circuit form. With an exceptionally thick service manual, the repair work is estimated to require over six months to complete.
