After experimenting with various types of wood, this densified wood may well be the optimal housing material I've been searching for. It's a very ancient processing technique that can enhance wood's density and rigidity. Its earliest application dates back to World War I, when it was used to make aircraft propellers.
The densification process not only allows adjustment of the wood's final density but also enables coloring - it's simply perfect.
Testing and simulation of the densified wood will commence shortly, and the results are highly anticipated.
