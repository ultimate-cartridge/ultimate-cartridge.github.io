New progress has been made with the densified wood housing. When installed on ultra-low tracking force, ultra-high compliance cartridges, it doesn't show significant vibration performance improvements compared to metal housings, unless the proportion of the housing in the overall cartridge structure is increased - though this compromises aesthetics.
However, when installed on high-quality, high tracking force, low compliance cartridges, the simulation and actual test data matched perfectly. Cartridge structural selection became much easier, and final tests revealed excellent compatibility between Jan Allaerts' MC series cartridges and the densified wood housing. The final assembled weight was 9.5g, which is highly satisfactory.
We reconstructed the MC series cartridges and manually installed the cantilever and stylus to compensate for angular errors introduced during assembly with the new housing.
