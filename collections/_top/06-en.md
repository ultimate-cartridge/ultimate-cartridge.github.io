After more than a year of continuous restoration, the NEUMANN driver is now fully operational. By combining the logic control circuits from two machines, we resolved most of the malfunctions. Many functional components were removed as they will no longer be used.
Following installation, test runs were conducted. During the final stage of the cutting process, some logical faults were detected in the bass pre-processing, which were successfully resolved through parameter adjustments.
