This commissioned design consists of two components: the cartridge and amplifier. Only the internal design will be shown, with no exterior display.
Thanks to the well-preserved vintage design documents and finished cartridge samples, the design process has progressed very smoothly. The amplifier follows an all-discrete component design approach with single-stage negative feedback and EQ settings completely different from RIAA standards - remarkably simple, as if returning to my student days of drafting.
With modern LED light sources now available, optical transduction technology outperforms mechanical vibration transduction in certain aspects. The sonic performance of the cartridge will take some time for the ears to adjust to, offering a completely different experience.
