This time we'll be replacing and repairing the Neumann cutting head for a vinyl record publisher. The new cutting head is working well, only requiring some gain adjustment on the amplifier module for optimal compatibility. The removed cutting head will be taken back for repair.
Although I never reveal my whereabouts, this time you might just figure out which publisher I visited :)
