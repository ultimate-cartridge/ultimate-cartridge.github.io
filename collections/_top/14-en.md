This was a truly memorable phono cartridge repair commission. Seeing so many Neumann DST cartridges appear at the same time was incredibly exciting.

Due to their age, each cartridge had varying degrees of damage, so we decided to completely remake them.

We documented the repair process using one of them as an example. First, we disassembled it to evaluate the repair plan. After determining how to address all the issues, we began work: derusting and polishing the pole pieces, applying passivation treatment to the metal surfaces. Every screw needed its slots recut. The magnets had severely weakened, so we manually remagnetized them based on preserved historical data. The assembly process required some special techniques - without them, post-assembly adjustments would have been impossible. We also polished the outer casing. The final assembled result looked fantastic. When we measured the frequency response parameters on our Neutrik test equipment, the data was quite satisfactory.
