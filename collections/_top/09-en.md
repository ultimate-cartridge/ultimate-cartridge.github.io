This might be the most meaningful work of the year.
A professional vinyl record publisher needed a completely new set of Neumann cutting machine drivers. Through a friend's recommendation, the task was entrusted to me. I had to track down contacts from my former colleagues at JVC to acquire them.
After six months, we finally located them. Although they needed to be shipped to Japan from two different countries, it wasn't particularly difficult.
For these three drivers, the amplifier circuits aren't a concern since we won't be using them. But the driver circuits - with their numerous discrete components and logic chips - pose a significant challenge as to whether they can still be repaired and adjusted back to working condition.
The work is expected to continue until next year. Here's hoping for the best of luck.
