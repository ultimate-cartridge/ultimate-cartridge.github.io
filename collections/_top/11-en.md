Today's meeting yielded a significant discovery. It's truly astonishing that some audio manufacturers want to apply amplifier testing standards and design principles to moving-coil cartridge production.
As the front-end device of an audio system, a cartridge picks up vibrations from vinyl records, not sound. It's inappropriate to approach cartridge design using the logic of amplifiers and speakers.
On a microscopic level, the grooves on a vinyl record are like uneven, unpaved mountain roads. Persistently pursuing cartridge designs with zero parameter tolerance is akin to manufacturing a supercar to drive on such unpaved roads—it would be a nightmare.
Please forgive this crude analogy. I couldn't find simpler words to explain the complex technology behind cartridge design. But consider this: Why is it that in today's era of highly specialized and precision-driven audio engineering, most moving-coil cartridges show no fundamental difference in sound quality? Why do our cartridge designs and upgrades always emphasize vibration coefficients, damping factors, compliance, center of gravity, and other parameters unrelated to traditional audio metrics?
These words serve as a reminder of our original intent. May every commission reflect genuine recognition of ULTIMATE CARTRIDGE's work.
