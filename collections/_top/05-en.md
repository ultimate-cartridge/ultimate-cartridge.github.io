This is what I consider to be the best cartridge transduction structure currently available. Each channel utilizes a single coil paired with an independent push-pull magnetic field for power generation. The completely non-interfering channel coils eliminate any separation issues. The complete N-S dual-pole magnetic field prevents any magnetic flux leakage problems.
However, the two cartridge models currently employing this design are not yet perfect.
The first uses an air-core coil where channel coil interference still exists, with coil internal resistance being too low and insufficient inductance.
The second uses an iron-core coil which solves the coil interference issue and has adequate internal resistance, but exhibits asymmetrical motion ratios between left and right channels.
Should any client require a cartridge with this structure, I will improve upon these existing issues and proceed with a redesign.
