<p>Ultimate Cartridge was officially established in Chiba Prefecture in October 2010 by five NHK audio engineers. At the time of its founding, the main business was the repair of MC cartridges and the design and repair of audio amplifiers.</p>

<p>In 2018, Dr. Matthias Schmelz, an audio engineer, joined the company and began designing MC cartridges for audio manufacturers. Prior to this, Dr. Schmelz had spent five years seconded from the BBC in the UK to NHK in Tokyo, supporting Mr. Akaseri’s MC cartridge development project. By 2020, the company had achieved full in-house production of all parts except for the cantilever and stylus tip, realizing complete independence in the design, production, and assembly of cartridges.</p>

<p>The current main business activities are as follows:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Contracted MC cartridge design and prototype development for audio manufacturers</li>
  <li>Aftermarket MC cartridge upgrades, remanufacturing, and advanced customization</li>
  <li>MC cartridge repair services, including for individual users</li>
</ul>
