# kiseki


Production of the modified Kiseki cartridge has ended because the original Kiseki cartridge can no longer be found.

A total of 32 units have been modified.

The cantilever has been upgraded from the original aluminum to a diamond-coated design, with an extended length for improved compliance. The coil material has been changed from copper to silver, resulting in more refined high-frequency performance. The housing has been redesigned in rosewood, offering a lower resonance point compared to the original metal shell.
