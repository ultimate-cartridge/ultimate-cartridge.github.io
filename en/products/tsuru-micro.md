# TSURU MICRO Gakushin

![TSURU MICRO](/assets/products/tsuru-micro/tsuru-micro1.png)

Thank you for your interest in our company’s newly designed phono cartridge. The Crane Song · Joyful God is a tribute to history, crafted with the utmost hand-built precision. The core materials of the cartridge originate from vintage stock, making the final product extremely limited—expected to be around 100 units in total.

## Vintage Electromagnetic Mechanism

Produced around 1970, the cartridge features 6N pure iron magnetic pole pieces paired with platinum-alloy magnets. After half a century of proper storage, unstable metallic properties have been naturally aged out, resulting in a stable and exceptionally high-performance magnetic-electrical transduction environment.

## Triple Resonance Control Design in Housing


### 1. Hybrid Sandwich Base Material:

The sandwich housing, composed of irregular long carbon fibers mixed with gold and ceramic resin, ensures rigidity while effectively suppressing vibrations. The resonance frequency is set at an extremely low level.


### 2. Composite Material Cantilever:

The cantilever utilizes a diamond structure, renowned for its superior sound velocity and rigidity, and is coated with an aluminum-magnesium alloy layer. This design effectively reduces self-excited vibrations that occur during large dynamic range playback.


### 3. Magnetic Damping Resonator:

Our patented design involves the hand-assembly of over 20 precision components. The resonance balls effectively absorb vibrations transmitted from the tonearm, while the precision magnetic field provides the driving force for rapid recovery. Additionally, magnetic damping is applied during the repositioning operation to resolve the vibration inertia of the balls. Under expert guidance, the magnetic driving force can be finely adjusted according to the tonearm used.
