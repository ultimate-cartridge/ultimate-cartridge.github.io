# Jan Allaerts (Ultimate-Cartridge Edition)   Arion MC Cartridge

Thank you very much for taking the time to view our cartridge works. It is an honor for us that our pickup, which stands at the forefront of analog sources, can drive your audio system.

The U.C. Arion is a thoroughly modified version of the J.A. MC series cartridge, assembled and adjusted entirely by Dr. Matthias Schmelz himself, without any assistance from others. In an era where most cartridges are mass-produced, we hope that the handcrafted Arion cartridge will bring you an extraordinary musical experience.

The Arion cartridge boasts astonishing dynamic expression. Its sense of scale, volume, instantaneous response in large spaces, and delicate gradation will leave a strong impression on listeners.

## Body

The Arion cartridge has evolved from the conventional J.A. metal case to a high-density processed wood case. While maintaining the lightness and low resonance characteristics of wood, it achieves mechanical strength comparable to metal materials. In addition, a variety of color customizations are now possible.

## Magnet System

In the Arion, the standard J.A. magnet has been upgraded to a specially magnetized version, handcrafted for optimal performance. The optimal magnetization and material composition were determined through years of simulation measurements and practical testing. By adding trace amounts of precious metals in a unique blend, there is no degradation due to pole interference or stray magnetic fields in the fringer field between the magnet poles. This provides the ideal power generation environment for the cartridge.

## Cantilever

The Arion pursues the ultimate in transmission accuracy and speed. Diamond material is currently the optimal solution for cantilevers, possessing nearly perfect physical properties in terms of elasticity, hardness, and sound velocity. Its high-speed, lossless vibration transmission enables sharp dynamics and a highly immersive soundstage.
At the microstructure level, each cartridge’s damping hardness coefficient and coil shape are unique. In the Arion, the cantilever and stylus are finely adjusted based on actual measurement data after assembly, ensuring a perfect match between the design simulation and the physical properties of the finished product. This artisan process is the decisive difference from mass-produced items.

## Cartridge and Tonearm Matching

A cartridge must be paired with a tonearm that matches its compliance and mass. In the industry, the resonance frequency is calculated using the formula F = 1000 / (2 × π × √(M × C)), with 6-14Hz as the standard range, 7-12Hz as the optimal range, and 9-11Hz as the ideal but difficult-to-achieve range. This formula is theoretical and idealized, not accounting for the damping effects of the cartridge in actual use.
The Arion cartridge applies laboratory-level measurement strategies throughout the design, processing, and assembly stages. After installation, the damping of the body, soft damping due to the elastic coefficient, and the actual damping characteristics of the cantilever and stylus are finely adjusted. As a result, the resonance frequency, which was higher in conventional J.A. cartridges, can be controlled within the optimal range. With standard values for tonearm damping and mass (light, medium, or heavy), the Arion cartridge’s compliance of 12μm/mN ensures, through simulation and sensor measurement, that the resonance frequency always falls within the 9-11Hz range.

## Important Notice

The Arion cartridge is not authorized for sale through any online shops. Please purchase only at physical stores. Purchases made by any other method will not be eligible for after-sales service.
